The Chinese symbols for risk shown above capture a key aspect of enterprise risk management. The first symbol represents “danger” and the second “opportunity.” Taken together, they suggest that risk is a strategic combination of vulnerability and opportunity. Viewed in this light, enterprise risk
management represents a tool for managing risk in a way that enables the corporation to take advantage of value enhancing opportunities. A missed strategic opportunity can result in a greater loss of (potential) value than an unfortunate incident or adverse change in prices or markets.

In creating ERM initiatives, companies focus on the downside of risk as well as the upside risk. Companies are supposed to consider competitive opportunities and strategic advantages and threats that might arise out of the deft management of risk. Risk analysis will help companies make better decisions, e.g., finding a location of a plant or office abroad, or avoid potential disasters down the road, e.g., unexpected and costly plant or equipment failure, by focusing on preventive measures.
