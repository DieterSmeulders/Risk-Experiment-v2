Here, you can find the instructions about making sandwiches:<br><br>

•	You will make sandwiches as they appear in the “order” window. Each sandwich needs to correspond to the recipe of the order received. <br><br>

•	You can access to the recipe (ingredient list) of each sandwich using a drop-down “Menu” box on the right side of the screen.<br>

•	You need to assemble the ingredients using the drop-down menus for the five different types of ingredients: breads, meats, cheese, vegetables, and condiments.<br>

•	You can add each ingredient to your sandwich by clicking on “add” in front of each type of ingredient. If you make a mistake and you want to correct, you can remove the ingredients by clicking on “Remove ingredients”.<br><br>

•	When you complete a sandwich, click on the “Finished” button. Once you click on the “Finished” button, you will send the sandwich for sale.<br>
•	All sandwiches that you send for sale will be sold if they are <b>without errors</b>. If a sandwich that you make has an error, you will receive an error message and be asked to modify your sandwich. Make as many sandwiches as you can, but do so with as little errors as possible.<br><br>


Your sales performance is important for the company. Sales performance is calculated as the number of sandwiches you make multiplied by the selling price of each sandwich, which is 1 euro.<br><br>


              <center><b>Sales performance = Number of sandwiches made * selling price of each sandwich</b></center><br><br><br>
