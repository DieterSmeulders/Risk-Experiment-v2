The practice session is over!<br><br>

The company has yet to open a shop in the north. <u>Two locations are selected as candidates for setting up a shop</u>. Given that you have more information about the region, the supervisor delegated the location decision to you. This decision is very important for the company because it requires a lot of investment and it influences the sales revenue of the shop.<br><br>
You will choose the best location based on the information collected about two locations and inform the supervisor about your decision. Afterwards, the company will invest in the location you have chosen and you can start working in the shop.<br><br>
