<b>Procedure:</b> <br><br>
<br>

1. For the first round, the supervisor will <u>not</u> allocate the production time to managers and each regional manager will be given <b>5</b> minutes of production time to make sandwiches. <br><br>
2. The regional managers make as many sandwiches as they can in the time given. <br><br>
3. Once the time is over, the regional managers will be informed about the <u>sales performance</u> they have achieved in this round. Furthermore, they receive a <u>local market survey report</u>, conducted in their shop during this round. As it is locally conducted, this survey report is <b>available only</b> to the shopâ€™s regional manager, not to others. <br><br>
4. Then the regional managers will send a report of the sales performance they achieved to the supervisor. The supervisor will receive the reports and subsequently allocate <b>10</b> minutes of production time between two regional managers for the next round. Each regional manager can make sandwiches <b>only</b> during the production time the supervisor will allocate to him/her in the next round.<br><br>
<u>The game will continue with steps 2,3, and 4 for the next rounds</u>.<br><br>


{% if group.reportingcondition ==  'mandatory' %}Note that the AC company has a <b>mandatory risk reporting policy</b>, that is, <b>along with sales performance, regional managers are required to report the risks (if any) that could impact the sales performance of their region going forward</b>. <br><br> {% endif%}
{% if group.reportingcondition ==  'voluntary' %}Note that the AC company has a <b>voluntary risk reporting policy</b>, that is, <b>along with sales performance, regional managers, if they wish, can report the risks (if any) that could impact the sales performance of their region going forward</b>. <br><br> {% endif%}

The company has set aside an <b>emergency monetary budget</b> in case of unexpected expenses/events in each region. At the beginning of each round, the supervisor can send a formal request to ask for this budget if she/he finds it necessary.<br><br>
