Here you can find the procedure for the next steps.<br><br>


1.	Making sandwiches: on the next page, you will receive instructions about how to make sandwiches. You will have 3 minutes to practice and get familiar with the task. Then, the main session will start. You will have 5 minutes to make as many sandwiches as you can.  The sales performance is calculated as the number of sandwiches you make multiplied by the selling price of each sandwich.<br><br>

2.	Receiving the local market survey: once the time is over, you will receive a local market survey. This survey provides local insights into the potential risks to the sales performance. This survey is available ONLY to you, not to the supervisor.<br><br>

3.	Risk reporting: {% if group.reportingcondition == 'mandatory' %} The company has a mandatory risk reporting policy, that is, you are required to report the risks (if any) that could impact the sales performance of your region going forward. {% else %}The company has a voluntary risk reporting policy, that is, you can, if you wish, report the risks (if any) that could impact the sales performance of your region going forward. {% endif %}<br><br>

4.	Receiving your performance rate: the supervisor will receive your risk report (if any) and use it for risk management purposes. S/he will also be informed about your sales performance in the sandwich making task. Then, s/he will rate your performance in a range from 1 (Very poor) to 5 (Excellent).<br><br>


Please note that the supervisor does not have access to the local report market survey and thus cannot validate your risk report.

You will receive 5 euros for completing the task irrespective of your performance, provided you answer 80% of the comprehension questions correctly.
