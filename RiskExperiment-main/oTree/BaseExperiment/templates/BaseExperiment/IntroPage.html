Thank you for participating in this study! <br><br>
<br><br>
You will receive {{ BasePay }} for completing this study regardless of the choices that you make. You can also receive additional money depending on your choices and the choices of other participants. <br><br>

Participants have one of three different roles. They will be randomly assigned to work for a specific company and play one of the following three roles: <b> a supervisor, a northern regional manager, and a southern regional manager </b>. A northern regional manager will be randomly paired with a southern regional manager and a supervisor, thus forming a triad of one supervisor and two regional managers who all work for the same company. You will receive instructions about your task and role. Please read them carefully.<br><br>

Participants will never know the identity of each other, so anonymity is preserved. You will not be deceived in any form. The data will be used only for the scientific purposes at the aggregated level. <br>

Participation is voluntary. At any point throughout the study, you can leave if you wish. However, for technical reasons, you will not be paid unless you complete the study. By clicking on “next”, you agree to participate in this study and the study will begin.
