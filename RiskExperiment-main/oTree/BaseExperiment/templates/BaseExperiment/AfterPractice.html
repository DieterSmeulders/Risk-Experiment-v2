<u>Your practice session is over!</u> <br><br>

Get ready to start the first round. The company has opened a shop in the location that you selected. In the first round, you have 5 minutes to make as many sandwiches as you can. All sandwiches that you make will be sold if they are without errors. Your sales performance is calculated as the number of sandwiches you make multiplied by the selling price of each sandwich, which is <b>1 dollar</b>.<br><br>

Half of the sales performance that you achieve will be paid out to you. The remaining half will be divided in two identical parts. One part will be paid out to the supervisor and one part will be for the company. <br><br>

<u>Below you can find the instructions of the sandwich-making task again: </u><br><br>

You will be asked to make sandwiches as they appear in the “order” window. You will have access to the recipe (ingredient list) of each sandwich using a drop-down “Menu” box on the right side of the screen. You will need to assemble the ingredients using the drop-down menus for five different types of ingredients: breads, meats, cheese, vegetables, and condiments. <br><br>

You can add each ingredient to your sandwich by clicking on “add” below each type of ingredient. You can remove the ingredients by clicking on “Remove ingredients” on the top of the screen. <br><br>

Each sandwich needs to correspond to the recipe of the order received. Thus, you will need to make sandwiches according to the orders received. When you complete a sandwich, click on the “Finished” button. Once you click on the “Finished” button, you will send the sandwich for sales. All sandwiches that you send for sales will be sold if they are without errors. If a sandwich that you make has an error, you will receive an error message and be asked to modify your sandwich. Thus, you need to make as many sandwiches as you can, but do so with fewest errors possible. <br><br>

<u>Before you start the first round, to ensure that you fully understand the instructions, please read very carefully the summary of the instructions in the form of Q&As on the next page.</u><br><br>
