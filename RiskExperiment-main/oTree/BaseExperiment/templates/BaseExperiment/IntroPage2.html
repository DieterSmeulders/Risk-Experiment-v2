You will work for AC Company. AC sells different sandwiches in a chain of sandwich shops.<br><br>

-	The supervisor is in charge of allocating the limited production resources in the form of production time to the regional managers.
-	Regional managers are in charge of sales performance in a specific region. The northern regional manager is in charge of sales performance in the north and the southern regional manager is in charge of sales performance in the south. The sales performance is calculated as the number of sandwiches regional managers sell multiplied by the selling price of each sandwich.

{font-weight: bold;
}

Sales performance = Number of saleable sandwiches * selling price of each sandwich <br><br>


-	Regional managers are compensated based on the sales performance they achieve in their own region. {{ employeepercent }}% of the sales performance that each regional manager generates in each round will be paid out to him/her. The rest of the revenue will be divided into two identical parts. One part will be paid to the supervisor and one part will be for the company.
